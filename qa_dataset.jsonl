{"prompt": "What are the major findings in this article?", "completion": "Undiagnosed depression in cancer patients is one of the biggest gaps in treatment"}
{"prompt": "Explain the key insights mentioned here.", "completion": "Depression, anxiety and other psychiatric conditions often go undetected and undiagnosed in patients. The neglect takes a significant toll on survival."}
{"prompt": "What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?", "completion": "Nov. 29, 2024, 12:00 PM UTC"}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "Simone Webster always struggled with her emotions and mood swings. But the floodgates really opened last year when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at 31 years old. \u201cThere must have been something I did,\u201d said Webster, her eyes watery. \u201cWhat did I do to cause this?\u201d"}
{"prompt": "How does this information relate to the overall theme?", "completion": "The depression came in waves, a deep hopelessness overwhelming Webster, now 33, and making her feel like she needed to escape reality. \u201cThere\u2019s so much you lose,\u201d Webster said, including her right breast, her boyfriend and her chance of having kids. \u201cIt feels really dumb to feel hopeful.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "How does this information relate to the overall theme?", "completion": "About a third of cancer patients struggle with depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, although these conditions often go undetected and undiagnosed. Kristin Kilbourn, a clinical psychologist at the University of Colorado Denver, said oncologists often don\u2019t want to open up this \u201ccan of worms,\u201d not to mention that mental health has long been deprioritized, with health care centers losing money caring for psychiatric patients."}
{"prompt": "How does this information relate to the overall theme?", "completion": "But this neglect comes at a significant cost, with mortality rates up to 39% higher among cancer patients with depression when compared to those without mental illness. Research also shows that the risk of suicide is 13 times higher in the week following a cancer diagnosis \u2014 and three times the average even a year later."}
{"prompt": "Summarize this content briefly.", "completion": "As Webster knows well, cancer\u2019s toll isn\u2019t limited to the body; it wages war on the mind too. While physicians and cancer centers have slowly increased mental health services, it\u2019s often up to patients to fill in gaps in care by advocating for themselves and proactively seeking out mental health support."}
{"prompt": "What does the author suggest as the next steps?", "completion": "\u201cYour oncologist is not going to identify your mood swings for you,\u201d Webster, of Washington, D.C., said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know if you\u2019re having suicidal ideation or depressed unless you tell them.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?", "completion": "How are cancer and mental illness linked"}
{"prompt": "What are the major findings in this article?", "completion": "Fear and sadness are normal reactions to a cancer diagnosis, said Dr. Santosh Rao, an oncologist at University Hospitals in Cleveland, but clinical depression and anxiety are distinct. \u201cIt\u2019s having a lack of interest in the things you like, changes in sleep patterns and food, potentially panic attacks\u201d over a prolonged period and with a significant impact on daily life, he said."}
{"prompt": "Explain the key insights mentioned here.", "completion": "Cancer can both aggravate and precipitate mental illness. In a 2023 study of 230,000 patients, 10% of people had depression or anxiety before their cancer diagnosis, and 22% were diagnosed afterward. New cases were most common among those with metastatic disease."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "This connection is often brought on by the psychological stress of a new cancer diagnosis, the existential dread of facing death, and the strain this disease places on relationships. \u201cCancer sometimes will bring people closer together, but a lot of times it\u2019ll actually exacerbate already frayed relationships,\u201d Rao said."}
{"prompt": "What does the author suggest as the next steps?", "completion": "Other drivers are the direct effects of cancer and the side effects of treatment, said Dr. Zev Nakamura, a psychiatrist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Uncontrolled pain, for example, can make people quit everyday activities and have trouble sleeping. Similarly, hormone-blocking drugs, which are commonly used for prostate and breast cancer, can contribute to fatigue and mood changes, while cancer surgeries can profoundly affect one\u2019s body image and sense of self. These can range from losing one\u2019s ovaries and uterus in a total hysterectomy to needing to use a colostomy bag to collect waste."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "Mental illness often continues even after completing cancer treatment, with research showing that survivors face a greater risk of mental illness even five years after their cancer diagnosis, compared to the general population. Nakamura noted that while mental health support can be limited for cancer patients, it\u2019s even more limited for survivors. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly not the capacity to provide ongoing, integrated mental health care,\u201d he said."}
{"prompt": "What is the main topic of this paragraph?", "completion": "Logan Piz, 25, knows this well. He was diagnosed with Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, a rare type of bone cancer, at age 12, but his psychological challenges really only started three years later."}
{"prompt": "What is the conclusion of this section?", "completion": "\u201cWhen you\u2019re in the height of your cancer diagnosis, you\u2019re trying to get through the days,\u201d said Piz, who lives in Truckee, California. \u201cYou start to push off all these feelings and dissociate in a way.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "Summarize this content briefly.", "completion": "But after treatment ended, Piz was slowly suffocated with anxiety, convinced the cancer was going to come back, and post-traumatic stress disorder, haunted by all his friends who had died of cancer. \u201cI would break down crying, not even understanding where that had come from,\u201d he said."}
{"prompt": "How does this information relate to the overall theme?", "completion": "Mental illness can be deadly for cancer patients because it often undermines their ability to follow through with treatment and adopt healthy habits like exercising, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol or drugs, Rao said."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "These are all behaviors associated with improved cancer survival. But \u201cit\u2019s harder to motivate yourself when depressed,\u201d he continued."}
{"prompt": "What is the main topic of this paragraph?", "completion": "Similarly, poorly managed mental health symptoms can decrease patients\u2019 willingness to start treatment or their ability to tolerate side effects, prompting some to cut back on their doses or discontinue treatment altogether, Nakamura said. As such, treating depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders can be lifesaving. In a 2020 study of 55,000 veterans with lung cancer, participating in a mental health treatment program was associated with 20%-25% lower risk of dying from cancer."}
{"prompt": "What is the main topic of this paragraph?", "completion": "Gaps in accessing mental health care"}
{"prompt": "Explain the key insights mentioned here.", "completion": "The challenge lies in ensuring cancer patients and survivors actually have access to mental health care."}
{"prompt": "What is the conclusion of this section?", "completion": "Even getting an appointment can be difficult: More than half of Americans live in regions federally designated as \u201cmental health professional shortage areas,\u201d and hospitals have largely underinvested in clinical psychology and psychiatry programs since they don\u2019t generate much revenue, according to Kilbourn, the clinical psychologist at UC Denver."}
{"prompt": "Summarize this content briefly.", "completion": "If a patient can get in, there\u2019s the question of whether they\u2019ll be able to pay. Only 20%-40% of mental health providers accept insurance, according to a 2017 study."}
{"prompt": "What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?", "completion": "Other cancer patients may not even realize there\u2019s a problem until too late. Many oncologists don\u2019t bring up mental health on their own, partially because they haven\u2019t been trained to talk about emotional well-being and because there\u2019s limited time during oncology visits. \u201cThey don\u2019t really feel comfortable with it,\u201d Kilbourn said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of what\u2019s going to come out, and they\u2019re not going to be able to manage it.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "What is the main topic of this paragraph?", "completion": "In Piz\u2019s case, mental health never really came up with his oncologist until he gathered the courage to discuss his symptoms independently. \u201cI think often that mental health might be seen as someone else\u2019s job,\u201d he said."}
{"prompt": "What are the major findings in this article?", "completion": "That may be changing."}
{"prompt": "What is the main topic of this paragraph?", "completion": "There\u2019s been a growing movement in the U.S. to integrate mental health with cancer care, according to Yasmin Asvat, a clinical psychologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Since 2015, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer has required all accredited centers to screen patients for psychological distress, and in a 2018 survey, 85% of cancer centers offered mental health services."}
{"prompt": "What are the major findings in this article?", "completion": "The benefit of such integration is that services are less stigmatizing and more easily accessible, she said, since patients don\u2019t need to coordinate yet another aspect of their care. Asvat, for example, will often see patients at Rush while they\u2019re getting their chemotherapy. Similarly, at UNC Chapel Hill, there is a patient and family resource center inside the cancer center that offers nutrition guidance, a wig shop, a library with mental health resources and psychiatrists like Nakamura, who see patients within two weeks of a referral."}
{"prompt": "What are the major findings in this article?", "completion": "However, the quality of integration varies tremendously, and this level of support is still the exception rather than the rule. \u201cMost people receive their care in community cancer settings, where you don\u2019t have mental health routinely embedded,\u201d Nakamura said."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "Despite the challenges, patients can take some steps to get the support they need."}
{"prompt": "What is the main topic of this paragraph?", "completion": "Asvat pointed to online self-screening tools, which are being increasingly used by patients. These can be helpful for starting conversations with oncologists, she said, adding that it\u2019s important to use tools that have been clinically validated and to understand that these results can\u2019t replace a formal diagnosis."}
{"prompt": "Explain the key insights mentioned here.", "completion": "More generally, patients need to advocate for themselves to ensure mental health is part of the cancer conversation, Rao said. It might even be helpful for patients to write down a list of concerns they want to discuss and share that with their oncologist, given how fast-paced these visits can be."}
{"prompt": "How does this information relate to the overall theme?", "completion": "Even if a referral to a mental health provider isn\u2019t realistic, oncologists can help as best they can and talk through available resources. For example, research shows that acupuncture, yoga and music therapy can help reduce depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with cancer. Rao, who is also the president of the Society for Integrative Oncology, said that mindfulness-based interventions in particular have some of the strongest evidence. \u201cThat\u2019s an approach focused on building awareness, on trying to stay in the moment and thinking about what might be triggering your emotions,\u201d he said."}
{"prompt": "What are the key arguments presented?", "completion": "Asvat said that support groups are also particularly popular, helping patients feel connected, valued and free to reimagine their cancer journey."}
{"prompt": "What is the conclusion of this section?", "completion": "Those support groups can take many forms."}
{"prompt": "What is the conclusion of this section?", "completion": "Piz helps lead First Descents, an outdoor adventure group for 18- to 45-year olds with cancer or multiple sclerosis. Participants go surfing, rock climbing and whitewater kayaking during the day, and gather around the campfire to share their hopes and fears at night."}
{"prompt": "How does this information relate to the overall theme?", "completion": "\u201cThe goal isn\u2019t to avoid falling in water; the goal is to get back up and to know that everyone on this trip is waiting for you,\u201d said Webster, who went on a First Descents trip in July. \u201cTo be around people who love you, having met you five days before, just because they know what it took for you to get here, there\u2019s really nothing quite like it.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?", "completion": "Other support groups are organized around everything from cooking to creative writing. At the Smith Center for Healing and the Arts in Washington, D.C., Webster attends regular supper clubs, where she learns about nutrition and connects with other survivors while cooking fresh-made pita, pumpkin ravioli and other plant-based foods."}
{"prompt": "Summarize this content briefly.", "completion": "The Smith Center also hosts monthly \u201cradical writing\u201d workshops, where participants free-write and share their work in a safe space. Webster had been looking for a place \u201cwhere I can just cry and fall apart,\u201d frustrated with how friends and family would tell her how lucky she is and sometimes dismiss her feelings. The workshops were so meaningful to her, Webster said, because they were \u201ca nonjudgmental space where I\u2019m allowed to grieve.\u201d"}
{"prompt": "What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?", "completion": "Kilbourn acknowledged that it\u2019s perhaps unrealistic to ask cancer patients to fill in these gaps, since this disease already demands so much of them and mental health is inherently a difficult topic to talk about. And that\u2019s not to mention how caregivers are often neglected, as they also face high rates of depression and anxiety but often don\u2019t receive any support, she said."}
{"prompt": "What does the author suggest as the next steps?", "completion": "Some of these challenges will be addressed with time, with a new generation of oncologists entering practice and emerging research into everything from mobile apps that expand access to care to psychedelic-assisted therapy that helps those with advanced cancer cope with depression, anxiety and existential distress. There are even new health care delivery models, where a single psychiatrist supervises a large panel of patients by leaning on social workers and nurses to meet with these patients and on primary care providers to prescribe medications."}
{"prompt": "What evidence does the author provide to support their claims?", "completion": "But there\u2019s no saying when mental health will become a standard part of cancer care."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because it\u2019s all wrapped up in money and these big medical systems, which are very hard to change,\u201d Kilbourn said. Still, support groups give her hope since they bring together cancer patients, survivors and caregivers across the country, fostering resilience and connection in a fractured health care landscape."}
{"prompt": "Can you provide a brief summary of the article's introduction?", "completion": "\u201cIt\u2019s only in the cancer groups where you meet people who have been out for many years where they could say, \u2018I hear you. I was where you were. Keep going.\u2019\u201d Webster said. \u201cNot one other person can tell you that.\u201d"}
