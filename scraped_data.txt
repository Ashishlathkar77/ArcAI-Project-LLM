President-elect Donald Trump has picked Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., to be his national security adviser, according to four sources familiar with the decision.

Waltz is a Green Beret veteran who served in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa. Since 2019, he has represented a congressional district in the House, where he's a member of the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees.

The Wall Street Journal first reported Trump’s pick.

Waltz’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Waltz is a particularly hawkish member of Congress when it comes to China. He's a member of the House’s China Task Force and has argued that the U.S. is underprepared if there is a conflict in the region.

Like many congressional Republicans, Waltz has also criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia. In an interview with NPR on Nov. 4, he said the U.S. had “leverage” to get Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table to negotiate a “diplomatic resolution” to end the war.

The role of White House national security adviser doesn’t require Senate confirmation.

Waltz joins Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York as the second House Republican Trump has tapped for posts in his new administration. He selected Stefanik to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.

President-elect Donald Trump has tapped House Republican Conference chair and longtime ally Rep. Elise Stefanik, of New York, to serve as ambassador to the United Nations.

Stefanik is Trump's first Cabinet pick for his second term in the White House.

“I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,” Trump said in a statement Monday.

Stefanik said she was "truly honored" by Trump's announcement.

"I stand ready to advance President Donald J. Trump’s restoration of America First peace through strength leadership on the world stage on Day One at the United Nations," she said in a statement.

News of Trump's pick was first reported by CNN.

Stefanik, 40, has been a staunch defender of Israel in its response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks and has been outspoken over the last year about antisemitism on college campuses. A day before last week's election, Stefanik reiterated her call for the defunding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East because she alleges it has been infiltrated by Hamas.

Israel has accused staff members of the organization of participating in the Oct. 7 terror attacks, prompting it to fire at least 10 people. Israel's parliament voted in late October to ban the organization's operations.

Stefanik has served as the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference since May 2021, after then-Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., was ousted over her vocal criticism of Trump. Stefanik has served in the House since 2015 and represents New York's 21st Congressional District, which covers upstate New York, bordering Vermont and Canada.

Any appointments by Trump that lead to vacancies in the House could prove problematic for House Republicans. While they could maintain control of the lower chamber, an election outcome that NBC News has not yet called, their margin will be slim, and they struggled throughout the last Congress to maintain effective control of the body with few votes to spare.

President-elect Donald Trump said on Saturday that oil and gas industry executive Chris Wright, a staunch defender of fossil fuel use, would be his pick to lead the Department of Energy.

Wright is the founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, an oilfield services firm based in Denver. He is expected to support Trump’s plan to maximize production of oil and gas and to seek ways to boost generation of electricity, demand for which is rising for the first time in decades.

He is also likely to share Trump’s opposition to global cooperation on fighting climate change. Wright has called climate change activists alarmist and has likened efforts by Democrats to combat global warming to Soviet-style communism.

“There is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either,” Wright said in a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year.

Wright, who does not have any political experience, has written extensively on the need for more fossil fuel production to lift people out of poverty.

He has stood out among oil and gas executives for his freewheeling style, and describes himself as a tech nerd.

Wright made a media splash in 2019 when he drank fracking fluid on camera to demonstrate it was not dangerous.

U.S. oil output hit the highest level any country has ever produced under Biden, and it is uncertain how much Wright and the incoming administration could boost that.

Most drilling decisions are driven by private companies working on land not owned by the federal government.

The Department of Energy handles U.S. energy diplomacy, administers the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — which Trump has said he wants to replenish — and runs grant and loan programs to advance energy technologies, such as the Loan Programs Office.

The secretary also oversees the aging U.S. nuclear weapons complex, nuclear energy waste disposal, and 17 national labs.

If confirmed by the Senate, Wright will replace Jennifer Granholm, a supporter of electric vehicles, emerging energy sources like geothermal power and a backer of carbon-free wind, solar and nuclear energy.

Wright will also likely be involved in permitting of electricity transmission and the expansion of nuclear power, an energy source that is popular with both Republicans and Democrats but which is expensive and complicated to permit.

Power demand in the United States is surging for the first time in two decades amid growth in artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and cryptocurrencies.
